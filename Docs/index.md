## Welcome to EventStreamDotNet

EventStreamDotNet is a simple, easy-to-use library that supports the Event Stream pattern for storing business data (also commonly known as Event Sourcing). It is based upon .NET Core 3.1 (soon to be .NET 5) and SQL Server. The README covers all the basic points about what it does and what the client applications do. The wiki provides a brief overview of the Event Stream pattern and the usually-related Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS) patterns -- which both naturally lead to Event Stream usage.

This is a completely separate stand-alone library, although you may be interested in my article about implementing a similar system using the Microsoft Orleans virtual actor model framework: [Event Sourcing with Orleans Journaled Grains](https://mcguirev10.com/2019/12/05/event-sourcing-with-orleans-journaled-grains.html).
